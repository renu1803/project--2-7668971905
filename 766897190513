An array can be define as an order of list of homogenous data element.These elements may be of int , float , char , etc .It store the data or elements in contiguous memory which means consecutive
memory location .It is zero base .Array is declared through a single variable : 
datatype<array_variablename>[rows][column];

It is different from regular variable it contain multiple values in list formate but regular variable contain only single value .we can access value from array using index value which start from 0 within 
square bracket [].Here is an example :
#include<stdio.h>
int main() 
{
  int arr[6]={1,3,4,6,7,8};
  printf("Element 4 of array is : %d ",arr[3]);
  return 0;
}
