Recursion in C programming refers to the process where a function call itself directly or indirectly. It is a powerful concept that simplified the complex problem by breaking them down into smaller ,
similar subproblems.This concept reduce the rewriting of multiple time same process by calling itself . 
#include<stdio.h>
int fact(int n)
{
  //  a function for a factorial through recursion 
  if(n<=1)
    return 1;
  else
    return n*fact(n-1);
}
int main() 
{
  int n , fac;
  printf("Enter the value for factorial : ");
  scanf("%d",&n); // taking input from user for factorial 
  fac=fact(n);
  printf("Factorial of %d is : %d",n,fac);
  return 0;
}
