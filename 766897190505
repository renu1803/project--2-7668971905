Recursion is the process which comes into existence when a function calls a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.Any function which calls itself is called recursive function,and such calls are called 
recursive calls .Recursive or recursion involves severval number of the recursive calls.It is important to impose a termination condition of recursion.

Recursion is a powerful programming technique that can be used to solve the problems that can be 
expressed in terms of similar problems of smaller size.

#include<stdio.h>
int fact(int n)
{
  if(n<=1){
  return 1;
}
  else{
  return n*fact(n-1);
}
int main() 
{
  int n,fac;
  printf("Enter the number for factorial: ");
  scanf("%d",&n);
  fac=fact(n);
  printf("Factorial is %d",fac);
  return 0;
}
